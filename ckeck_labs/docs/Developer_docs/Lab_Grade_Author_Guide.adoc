== Overview

FTL (Finish the Labs) provides a platform to both grade and solve student labs. In addition it provides hooks to update the students results to the LMS. This guide covers the topic of how to create a series of lab grading playbooks for a course.

Before we look at creating *grading* playbooks it is valuable to understand the typical workflow of a student grading a lab.

=== Student Workflow

. Student provisions lab as instructed via http:labs.opentlc.com
** *FTL* is inserted automatically at provisioing time
** *FTL* is fully provisioned with necessary meta-data and utilities
. Student works through lab
. Student is prompted at end of lab to grade the lab via a simple copy and paste in terminal window e.g.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ grade_lab ansible_foundations 03_01
----
+
NOTE:  syntax: `<grade_lab command> <course_name> <lab_and_sub-lab_number`
e.g. Grade the first lab in *Ansible Foundations Module 3 
. On success:
** Student informed
** *LMS* Updated (As of 2019-04-26 roles is called but API logic incomplete"
. On failure:
** Student is informed
** *LMS* Updated (As of 2019-04-26 roles is called but API logic incomplete"
+
NOTE: Student can try repeatedly until success is achieved.

On completion of a lab the student will copy and paste the lab checking command which will wrap the `lab_grading` playbook which will:

=== Notes

NOTE: In version 1.0 no attempt is made to generate a score. A student either passes or fails.

This guide focusses on Step 3 above and how to successfully create grading (and solving) playbooks

* *grading* playbooks: checks a students work by validating key steps have been completed
* *solver* playbooks: solves an entire lab
** Can be called sequentially i.e. each lab in a course, to validate a lab infrastructure is valid

=== Instructor Workflow
.Creating grading and solving playbooks


Identify the key tasks to validate in a student lab. In a lab of any complexity it can be considered a good practice to check at multiple stages the students progress. Just testing the final stage or end result, for example testing a URI for an expected response doesn't allow detailed feedback to the student.

Test critical stages.



TIP: Whilst a complex lab may be easy to test by the response for say the final application, upon student failure

=== Structure

At the root level of the FTL repo the directory `courses/` is used to hold each course in a course directory. *All* course grading content including lab specific roles should be encapsulated in your course directory which you can create here.. _(For those familiar with link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/tree/development/ansible[Ansible Agnostic Deployer] this pattern is similar to its `configs`)_

Each *course* directory e.g. `courses/ansible_engine_foundations/` contains all playbooks, metadata (e.g. inventory files, lab specific roles etc), and sub directories for each lab.
